# Penetration Testing Lab 


### Creating a penetration Lab @Home

Using [Virtual Box]() to setup our pentesting lab, `Virtual Box` allows us to create virtual machines inside our current OS.

[`Download Virutal Box`](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)


Creating Following machines in our Home Lab(for now) :
  - Attacker Machine -- [Kali Linux]()
  - Victim 1 -- [Windows]()
  - Victim 2 -- [Ubuntu Linux]()

`Download Kali Linux`

 - Kali linux is a linux distribution based on Debian, Kali is especially made for pentesters, it contains most of the tools that we need, installed and configured correctly.

 - *This is going to be the attacker machine*
    -  You can download Kali Pre Built machines from the following link:
       -  https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines
    - or Use the ISO Image 

[`Installing Metasploitable`]()

Metasploitable is a vulnerable linux distro, this OS contains a number of vulnerabilites, it is designed for pentesters to try and hack it.

This is going to be one of the victims that we will try to hack

`Download Metasploitable`
 download from this link :

[`Installing Windows`]()

Running a normal windows machine as a victim, we will be running our attacks against this machine.

Microsoft has released a number of windows virtual machines that can be downloaded from the following link 
  - Make sure you select windows 10 stable and virtual box
  - https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/


[`Snapshots`]()

Snapshots allow us to save the state of a virtual machine which can be used as a bookmark to go back and forward to different configurations.

Store stable state, updated state, etc...
