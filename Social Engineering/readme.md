## Social Engineering

*art of manipulating people*

**Hacking target through people..**
  - Target can be :
    - Person
    - Company
    - Website, etc..

### [STEP 1 : INFORMATION GATHERING]()

 - Gather Information about target (company/website/person)
 - Discover associated websites, links, companies
 - Associated people, names, emails, phone numbers, social networks, friends
 - Associated social networking accounts
 - Display all info on a graph and build attack strategies
 
 
### [STEP 2 : GENERATING EVIL FILES]()

 - Create basic evil files for most common operating systems this includes (but not limited to) :
    - Backdoors
    - Keyloggers
    - Password recovery tools
    - Download and execute payloads
    - Download and report payloads
    

### [STEP 3 : ENHANCING EVIL FILES]()

  - Bypass all anti-virus programs
  - Create trojans for most common operating systems
  - Embed evil code in microsoft office documents
  - Make evil file look and function like a normal file(pdf/image, etc..)
  - Create perfect spying tools
  
 
### [STEP 4 : DELIVERY METHODS]()
  
  - Smart SOcial engineering techniques to deliver evil files
  - Fake login pages
  - Fake update pages
  - Fake update popups
  - Mail Spoofing
  - Fake website/youtube traffic and many more !
  
  
### [STEP 5 : POST EXPLOITATION]()

  - Control computers we hacked
  - Access files system (open, edit, remove, upload, download) files
  - Spying
  - Privilege escalation
  - Accessing Camera
  - Pivoting and many more !
  
  
### [STEP 6 : SECURITY]()

  - Secure yourself from social engineering attacks
  - File Integrity
  - Analyse files
  - Analyse network connections and running services
  - Run files in sandbox
